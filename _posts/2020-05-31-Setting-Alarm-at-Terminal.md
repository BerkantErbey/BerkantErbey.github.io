In this post, I will explain how to set up an alarm at the terminal.

Sometimes we need to set alarms while working on computer. In such cases, we can use the terminal instedad of phone, website or gui-app.

Basically, we are waiting for a certain time and play sound for alarm. We will use **sleep** command to wait for a certain time.
To play audio we will use any media player that can work from terminal.

The parameter we write after the **sleep** command specifies the time we wait.

```sleep 5s```

(s->second, m->minute, h->hour)

We will use **&&** to run two commands together in terminal.

```command1 && command2```
